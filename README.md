# Tklib or Tk Libraries
This is a massive include with quite some additions and will be updated as frequent as possible adding more stuff.
This was renamed from Tk Include to Tk Libraries when 1.2.0 was released.

Will be later converted into being natives and using a custom extension to read from.

Also includes modified/updated SourceMod includes.

Pro tip: using 'stock' makes only those that are being used out of the include to be compiled with and the rest will be ignored/not compiled. (useful info)
