# Tklib or Tk Libraries
This is a massive include with quite some additions and will be updated as frequent as possible adding more stuff.
This was renamed from Tk Include to Tk Libraries when 1.2.0 was released.

### Also includes modified/updated SourceMod includes.

### Note: if you don't want multi-colors to be included in your compile, simply define `NoMultiColors` before the tklib include.

Pro tip: using `stock` makes only those that are being used out of the include to be compiled with and the rest will be ignored/not compiled.
Using `public` will only make it be part of the compilation even if not used. (Compiler will see it as a forward if not used inside plugin).
