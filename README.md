# Tklib or Tk Libraries
This is a massive include with quite some additions and will be updated as frequent as possible adding more stuff.
This was renamed from Tk Include to Tk Libraries when 1.2.0 was released.

Also includes modified/updated SourceMod includes.

#Note: if you don't want multi-colors to be included in your compile, simply define NoMultiColors before the tklib include.

Will be later converted into being natives and using a custom extension to read from.

Pro tip: using 'stock' makes only those that are being used out of the include to be compiled with and the rest will be ignored/not compiled.
