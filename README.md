# Tklib or Tk Libraries
This is a massive include with quite some additions and will be updated as frequent as possible adding more stuff.
This was renamed from Tk Include to Tk Libraries when 1.2.0 was released.

# [Functions](https://github.com/Teamkiller324/Tklib/blob/main/functions.md)

### Also includes modified/updated SourceMod includes.

# Note: if you don't want multi-colors to be included in your compile, simply define NoMultiColors before the tklib include.

Pro tip: using 'stock' makes only those that are being used out of the include to be compiled with and the rest will be ignored/not compiled.
